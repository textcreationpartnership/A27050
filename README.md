#####Body#####
CHAP. I. The Reaſons of this Writing.I Am not ignorant how diſpleaſing it will be to the Prelates, t
    _ CHAP. I. The Reaſons of this Writing.

    _ CHAP. II. The Engliſh Dioceſan Prelacy, and Church-Government, truly deſcribed; that it may be known what it is which we diſown.

    _ CHAP. III. Our Judgment of the Hiſtory of the Antient Church-Government, and of the riſe of the Dioceſan Prelacy.

    _ CHAP. IV. The Judgement of thoſe Nonconformiſts (now ſilenced) who 1660. addreſſed themſelves to King Charles the Second for Concord in the matter of Church-Government: what they then offered, and what thoſe of the Authors mind now hold, as to the Right of what is before Hiſtorically related.

    _ CHAP. V. Concerning the Writers of this Controverſie; With a Summary Anſwer to the Chief that write againſt the Cauſe which I defend.

      * The Oppoſers of Prelacy.

    _ CHAP. VI. That it is not of Gods inſtitution, nor is pleaſing to him that there be no Churches and Biſhops but in Cities; or that a City with its territories, or Country adjacent, be the bounds of each Church.

    _ CHAP. VII. The Definition and reaſons of a Dioceſan Church conſidered, and overthrown.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Whether the Infidel Territories or Citizens do make part of a Dioceſane Church.

    _ CHAP. IX. Whether converting a Dioceſe give right to the Converter to be their Biſhop or Governour.

    _ CHAP. X. That a particular Church of the firſt or loweſt order, muſt conſiſt of Neighbour Chriſtians aſſociated for Perſonal Communion in local preſence, in holy worſhip and converſation; and not of ſtrangres ſo remote, as have only an Internal Heart-Communion, or an External Communion by the mediation of others.

    _ CHAP. XI. That a Biſhop or Paſtor of a particular Church of the firſt rank aforedeſcribed, muſt Govern it ſtatedly, as preſent by himſelf, and not as in abſence by another.

    _ CHAP. XII. The juſt opening and underſtanding of the true nature of the Paſtoral office and Church Government, would end theſe controverſies about Epiſcopacy.

    _ CHAP. XIII. That there is no need of ſuch as our Dioceſans for the Unity or the Government of the particular Miniſters, nor for the ſilencing of the unworthy.

    _ CHAP. XIV. The true Original of the warrantable Epiſcopacy in particular Churches, was the notorious diſparity of abilities in the Paſtors: And the original of that tyrannical Prelacy into which it did degenerate, was the worldly Spirit in the Paſtors and people, which with the world came by proſperity into the Church. Quaere, Whether the thing ceaſe not, where the reaſon of it ceaſeth?

1. THE Second Part.

    _ CHAP. I. The clearing of the ſtate of the Queſtion.

    _ CHAP. II. The firſt Argument againſt the Engliſh Dioceſans; That their form (quantum in ſe) deſtroyeth the particular Church Form of God's Inſtitution, and ſetteth up a Humane Form in its ſtead.

    _ CHAP. III. That the primitive Epiſcopal Churches of the Holy Ghoſts Inſtitution, were but ſuch Congregations as afore deſcribed.

    _ CHAP. IV. The ſame proved by the Conceſſion of the moſt Learned Defenders of Dioceſane Prelacy.

    _ CHAP. V. The ſame proved by the full Teſtimony of Antiquity.

    _ More Teſtimonies of Councils added to the former Chap. 5.

    _ CHAP. VI. The ſame further confirmed by the Ancients.

    _ CHAP. VII. More Proofs of the aforeſaid Limits of Churches.

    _ CHAP. VIII. That the Dioceſans cauſe the errour of the Separatiſts, who avoid our Churches as falſe in their Conſtitution; and would utterly diſable us to confute them.

    _ CHAP. IX. The ſecond Argument: from the Depoſition of the primitive ſpecies of Biſhops, and the erecting of a humane inconſiſtent ſpecies in their ſtead: A ſpecifick difference proved.

    _ CHAP. X. Whether any form of Church Government be inſtituted by God as neceſſary? or all left to humane prudence?

    _ CHAP. XI. Argument 3. From the deſtruction of the order of Presbyters of Divine Inſtitution, and the Invention of a new order of Sub-half-Presbyters in their ſtead.

    _ CHAP. XII. That God inſtituted ſuch Presbyters as had the foreſaid power of the Keys, in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline; and no other, proved by the Sacred Scriptures.

    _ CHAP. XIII. The ſame confirmed by the Ancients.

    _ CHAP. XIV. The Confeſſions of the greateſt and Learnedeſt Prelatiſts.

    _ CHAP. XV. Whether this Government belonging to the office of Preſbyters, be in foro Eccleſiae & exteriore, or only in foro Conſcientiae & interiore.

    _ CHAP. XVI. That the Engliſh Dioceſane Government doth change this office of a Presbyter of Gods inſtitution into another (quantum in ſe) of humane invention.

    _ CHAP. XVII. That the great change of Government hitherto deſcribed (the making of new ſpecies of Churches, a new Epiſcopacy, and a new ſort of half-ſub-presbyters, with the Depoſition of the old,) was ſinfully done, and not according to the intent of the Apoſtles.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. The fourth Argument, From the Impoſſibility of their performance of the Epiſcopal Office, in a Dioceſane Church; And the certain excluſion and deſtruction of true particular Church Government, while one man only will undertake a work too great for many hundreds.

      * ARGUMENT IV.

    _ CHAP. XIX. The ſame Impoſſibilty proved by Experience.

    _ CHAP. XX. Objections againſt Pariſh Diſcipline anſwered.

    _ CHAP. XXI. The Magiſtrates Sword is neither the ſtrength of Church diſcipline, nor will ſerve inſtead of it, nor ſhould be too much uſed to ſecond and enforce it.

    _ CHAP. XXII. An Anſwer to the Objections. 1. No Biſhops no King. 2. And of the Rebellions and Seditions of thoſe, that have been againſt Biſhops.

    _ CHAP. XXIII. Four dou•le charges I have now proved againſt the foredeſcribed Dioceſane f•rm of Government, the leaſt of which alone is enough to prove it utterly unlawful.

    _ CHAP. XXIV. Some teſtimonies of Prelatiſts of the late ſtate of the Church of England, leſt we be ſuppoſed partial in our deſcription of it.

    _ CHAP. XXV. The Ordination lately exerciſed by the Presbyteries in England is valid: Ergo Reordination unneceſſary.
